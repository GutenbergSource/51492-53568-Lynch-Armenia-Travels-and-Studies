<HTML><BODY>This is volume two of H.F.B. Lynch's <i>Armenia, travels and studies</i>, an extensive work on Armenia, written near the start of the Armenian genocide. It gives an interesting picture of Armenia, and is lavishly illustrated with photographs taken during the author's travel. The work is split in two volumes, the first on the part of Armenia that was then in the Russian empire, and the second on the part of Armenia that was part of the Ottoman empire.

<p>The text is not fairly difficult, although a few citations in Greek appear, as well as numerous long footnotes in a smaller type. For ease of PP, I've moved all the full-page illustrations (on unnumbered pages) to the end of the project. During PP I will restore them to their original location. The bibliography and index at the end of volume 2 are in fairly small type.</BODY></HTML>
